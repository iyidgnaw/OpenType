/// The redesign's type, shape, colour and spacing scale (2026-08 handoff,
/// `design_handoff_opentype_redesign_v1`).
///
/// **These are the mockup's own values, not a six-step abstraction over them.**
/// An earlier pass implemented the README's closed scale — six type sizes, four
/// radii, one border — and collapsed everything the markup drew between those
/// steps. The owner reversed that on 2026-08-15: 稿子优先, the mockup wins
/// unconditionally where the two disagree. So the steps below are wider than
/// the README describes, and that is deliberate; the README's scale section is
/// the document that is now out of date, and `docs/reviews/` records the
/// contradiction for the design side.
///
/// The file still exists for the reason it always did: values live here under
/// names, once, instead of as literals sprinkled through six view files. What
/// changed is only how many steps there are, not whether they are shared.
///
/// Everything here is a value from the handoff, not an interpretation of it.
/// Deviations belong in a comment saying why, not in a quietly different
/// number.
///
/// Two consequences of 稿子优先 that are easy to undo by accident:
///
/// - **Colours are literal, not semantic.** The app is pinned to the light
///   appearance (`OpenTypeApp`), and the handoff's values are absolute — its
///   contrast is computed against `#fff` and `rgba(0,0,0,α)`, not against
///   whatever the system decides a separator is. `Color.primary.opacity(0.07)`
///   is *not* `rgba(0,0,0,.07)`: `labelColor` is black at 0.85, so that
///   expression resolves to 0.0595. Borders and ink below are therefore built
///   from literal black and literal `#1C1C1E`.
/// - **Ink is its own axis.** SwiftUI's hierarchical styles offer three usable
///   levels (≈ .85 / .50 / .26). The handoff uses a dozen, and most of them sit
///   in the `.30–.45` band the hierarchical styles skip entirely — which is
///   where every group label, timestamp, figure note and row action lives.
///   `DS.Colour.ink(_:)` is that axis; `.tertiary` is not a substitute for it.
