// The redesigned 设置 screen (2026-08 handoff §5, mockup 03C).
//
// The old Settings tab was nine stacked sections in a 420pt column, and three
// of them — provider setup, MCP, memory — were full configuration surfaces
// inlined into a list. That is why it had a `DisclosureGroup`: there was
// nowhere else to put anything, so everything was on one page and the
// dangerous parts had to be hidden behind a twisty.
//
// This splits it in two. `SettingsColumn` is five groups of short rows, laid
// out in two columns when there is room; anything that needs a form of its own
// becomes a row with a `chevron.right` that pushes a page into the detail
// column (`SettingsDetailColumn`). The two provider rows carry the answer to
// the question people actually open Settings for — *what is it using right
// now?* — in mono on the row itself, so the common case needs no click at all.
//
// Every value here comes from `DS`, and every one of them is the value 03C's
// markup literally sets — 11.5pt subtitles, `rgba(28,28,30,.45)` ink,
// `rgba(0,0,0,.09)` chip borders. An earlier pass rounded those onto the
// README's closed scale (12pt, `.secondary`, one border token); the owner
// reversed that on 2026-08-15 with 稿子优先, so the mockup wins wherever the
// two disagree. The rule that survives is the one that mattered: the value
// lives in `DS` under a name, never as a literal in this file.

/// 设置's list column: five groups, two columns when the column is wide

/// content area (the mockup's 908pt case) and degrades to a single scrolling
/// column when it is the 334pt list beside a pushed sub-page. Neither layout
/// changes a row's own metrics; only the page padding moves, exactly as the
/// handoff specifies for every other screen.
